# Sectional-Curvature
Mathematica code for calculating sectional curvature in Riemannian manifolds, given the metric tensor.

This work appeared in the peer-reviewed publication The Mathematica Journal (www.mathematica-journal.com). It is coauthored with two undergraduate students. Please inform me before using this code in any commercial work.

This repository contains both a published version (also available at https://www.mathematica-journal.com/2020/03/19/sectional-curvature-in-riemannian-manifolds/), and a "code only" version, which may be more helpful for those looking to build on it.
